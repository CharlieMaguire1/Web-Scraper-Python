# Web Scraper Project

The objective of this project is to parse XML sitemaps using Python.

This code was written using Jupyter Notebook and saved as a .py file.
I used the Anaconda Terminal to test the functionality and to change errors.

You can use multiple terminals to run this code including, I used Windows Powershell seen below.
